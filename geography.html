        Jakarta covers 661.23 km2 (255.30 sq mi), the smallest among any Indonesian provinces. However, its 
        metropolitan area covers 6,392 km2 (2,468 sq mi), which extends into the two bordering provinces of West 
        Java and Banten. The Greater Jakarta area includes three bordering regencies (Bekasi Regency, Tangerang
        Regency and Bogor Regency) and five adjacent cities (Bogor, Depok, Bekasi, Tangerang and South Tangerang).

        Jakarta is situated on the northwest coast of Java, at the mouth of the Ciliwung River on Jakarta Bay, an 
        inlet of the Java Sea. It is strategically located near the Sunda Strait. The northern part of Jakarta is 
        plain land, some areas of which are below sea level, and subject to frequent flooding. The southern 
        parts of the city are hilly. It is one of only two Asian capital cities located in the southern hemisphere 
        (along with East Timor's Dili). Officially, the area of the Jakarta Special District is 661.23 km2 (255 sq 
        mi) of land area and 6,977 km2 (2,694 sq mi) of sea area. The Thousand Islands, which are 
        administratively a part of Jakarta, are located in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.

        Jakarta lies in a low and flat alluvial plain, ranging from -2 to 91 m (-7 to 299 ft) with an average 
        elevation of 8 m (26 ft) above sea level with historically extensive swampy areas. Some parts of the city 
        have been constructed on reclaimed tidal flats that occur around the area. Thirteen rivers flow through 
        Jakarta. They are Ciliwung River, Kalibaru, Pesanggrahan, Cipinang, Angke, Maja, Mookervart, Krukut, 
        Buaran, West Tarum, Cakung, Petukangan, Sunter River and Grogol River. They flow from the Puncak highlands 
        to the south of the city, then across the city northwards towards the Java Sea. The Ciliwung River divides 
        the city into the western and eastern districts. These rivers, combined with the wet season rains and 
        insufficient drainage due to clogging, make Jakarta prone to flooding.
