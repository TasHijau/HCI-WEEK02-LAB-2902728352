        least US$1 billion and 18 live in Jakarta. The cost of living continues to rise. Both land prices and rents 
        have become expensive. Mercer's 2017 Cost of Living Survey ranked Jakarta as the 88th costliest city in the 
        world for expatriates.Industrial development and the construction of new housing thrive on the outskirts, 
        while commerce and banking remain concentrated in the city centre. Jakarta has a bustling luxury 
        property market. Knight Frank, a global real estate consultancy based in London, reported in 2014 that 
        Jakarta offered the highest return on high-end property investment in the world in 2013, citing a supply 
        shortage and a sharply depreciated currency as reasons.
