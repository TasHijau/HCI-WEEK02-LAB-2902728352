        <p>
        Jakarta is administratively equal to a province with special status. The executive branch is headed by an 
        elected governor and a vice governor, while the Jakarta Regional People's Representative Council 
        (Indonesian: Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Provinsi Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta, DPRD DKI Jakarta) is 
        the legislative branch with 106 directly elected members. The Jakarta City Hall at the south of Merdeka 
        Square houses the office of the governor and the vice governor and serves as the main administrative office.
    </p>
    <p>
        Executive governance consists of five administrative cities (Indonesian: Kota Administrasi), each headed by 
        a mayor (walikota) and one administrative regency (Indonesian: Kabupaten Administrasi) headed by a regent 
        (bupati). Unlike other cities and regencies in Indonesia where the mayor or regent is directly elected, 
        Jakarta's mayors and regents are chosen by the governor. Each city and regency is divided into 
        administrative districts.
    </p>
        Aside from representatives to the provincial parliament, Jakarta sends 21 delegates to the national lower 
        house parliament. The representatives are elected from Jakarta's three national electoral districts, which
        also include overseas voters. It also sends 4 delegates, just like other provinces, to the national 
        upper house parliament.
    <p>
        The Jakarta Smart City (JSC) program was launched on 14 December 2014 with the goal of smart governance, 
        smart people, smart mobility, smart economy, smart living, and a smart environment in the city using the
        web and various smartphone-based apps.
